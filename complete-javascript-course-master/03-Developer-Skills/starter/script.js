//SETTING UP PRETTIER AND VS CODE-------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
//PRETTIER----------------
//prettier is an opienated code formatter, which means it makes assumptions about how good code should look like, so if we use it the code will be nicely formatted

//after installing prettier, second step is to define prettier as the default formatter of our code

const x = '27';
if (x == 27) console.log(x);

//DOCS: https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html (for editing prettier)
//easiest way to configure pretier is to create a configuration file in the current project folder '.prettierrc'

//SNIPPETS---------------
//files => prferences => user snippets => new global snippets file => then enter the 'name' for the file
console.log();

//INSTALLING NODE JS AND SETTING UP A DEV ENVIRONMENT-----------------------------------------------
/*
//Live server
//we can create live server 1.either by installing the vs code extension, 2.another way(professional way) is to use node js and npm package
//1.METHOD: download 'live server' extension, bottom right corner of screen press 'Go Live' button which has appeared after installation
//2.METHOD: install node js(node js is a javascript runtime, node js is a way of running javascript outside the browser and also runnning development tools like the 'live server'), then install npm package named 'live server'

//install node js, open terminal and type 'node-v', this will give version of npm, then type in terminal 'npm install live-server -g' for installing live server, '-g' means globally this will make live server available all over the computer
//npm is node package manager, which is basically a program to download tools
//now if you type 'live-server' in terminal and press enter, it will start
console.log(`javascript is funny`);
